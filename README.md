A website to track climbing routes. Link to deployed website https://main--climbers-peak.netlify.app (Deployed using Netlify)

This website was created for learning purposes. This website uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) as well as Tailwindcss. Some code was used from the official React and Tailwind CSS docs and was modified for use in the creation of this project.

Difficulties faced when working on this project and how I overcame them:
 - no prior experience using react before this app - Looked up resources and official documentation as well as examples of best practices, applied prior knowledge of HTML and JavaScript
 - no prior experience with Tailwind - I have some experience with vanilla CSS already so I used Tailwind documentation to understand the Tailwind classNames and their vanilla CSS counterparts
 - no prior experience with MongoDB or any database - Learned from ground up about the workings of MongoDB necessary for the project
 - no prior experience building a web api - learned Node and Express technologies in order to create an api that connects to the MongoDB database

Total time taken to complete: About 4 months, started around May 2024 and completed August 2024

I wouldn't call myself an expert in anything in this project and there will be some small rolling modifcations I may still do to the frontend in the future in terms of formatting and potential security measures but for the most part this project is complete. It was diffuclt but I learned a lot and it was a fun experience. The best part was finally seeing the website brought fully to life after deployment. I am overjoyed I was able to see the project through to completion and I'm glad I never gave up on it.
